# Credit-Risk-Approval

Trained a model using train_test_split and LogisticRegression to help autonomously determine if a bank is likely to accept an applicants loan request based on factors such as:
"Gender,Married,Dependents,Education,Self_Employed,ApplicantIncome,CoapplicantIncome,LoanAmount,Loan_Amount_Term,Credit_History,Property_Area". We cleaned the data, removeed or replaced null values appropriately, and changed data types of objects to integers so that the model is able to handle the data.

##Model:
* We were able to achieve an accuracy score of 0.7310924369747899
  
##Technologies:
* Python: scikit-learn, logisticregression, pandas, github, git
  
##DATA: 
* Data set was grabbed: Datahack
